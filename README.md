## 💭 Philosophy

> "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - Donald Knuth
> But when optimization matters, **make it count**.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that performs when it needs to. Systems programming taught me to respect hardware, understand trade-offs, and never stop learning.
